        <p>Considered one of the most tragic and moving anime of its time, Your Lie in April has broken the hearts of music lovers and non-music lovers alike. Kaori and Kousei's whirlwind romance is a bittersweet tragedy that ends in loss. It also completely overshadows the other complicated dynamics within the main cast.</p>

        <p>In the end, Tsukasa wakes up and Isla apologizes for not telling him earlier that she has 1,000 hours remaining in her lifespan. Tsukasa promises that he will stay with Isla until the end, no matter what. He then asks if she would be willing to go out with him again, to which she smiles and takes his hand.</p>
